        <p>Keeping diaries is creating our personal archive of our life, and blogging, a personal online collection of
            diaries, is a dynamic and influential form of online expression that has transformed the way we share ideas,
            stories, and information.</p>
        <p>I am grateful and proud of Blogging website, which allows me to create my first blog: my submission for 30MFF
            at NYU Abu Dhabi (Click at the picture below)! Hope you enjoy.

        <iframe width="780" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HlT4bdnsxzE"></iframe>
        <p>The sun hung high in the cloudless sky, casting a golden glow upon the world below. It was the perfect summer
            day, and excitement filled the air as I embarked on a long-anticipated trip to explore the day.</p>
        <p>The car's tires crunched over the seashell-strewn road, and the scent of saltwater grew stronger with each
            passing mile. Windows rolled down, allowing the coastal breeze to ruffle the children's hair and carry the
            distant sound of seagulls' cries.</p>
        <p>As I approached the coast, the deep blue expanse of the ocean stretched out before me, endless and
            inviting. The children on the coast widened their eyes in wonder as they caught their first glimpse of the
            sparkling waves. The beach, with its soft, sun-kissed sand, welcomed me like an old friend.</p>
        <p>The water beckoned, its cool touch refreshing against the warm sand. The children dashed toward the waves,
            squealing with delight as they splashed and frolicked in the shallows. Each crashing wave felt like a
            playful embrace from the ocean, washing away the cares of the world. Adults, riding their water jets, were
            also indulging themselves in this heat and energy of summer.</p>

        <p>Those on the beach, taking a moment to relax, reclined on beach chairs beneath the shade of the
            umbrella.
            They watched their children with smiles, cherishing these moments of pure, unadulterated
            happiness. Seagulls
            glided overhead, their graceful wings casting shadows on the sand.</p>
        <p>Soon, the afternoon approached. Back to the city, as the sun graces the urban landscape with its
            warmth,
            parks and green spaces become popular retreats, where picnickers gather and children frolic.
            Sidewalk cafes
            spill onto the streets, filling the air with the tantalizing aroma of diverse cuisines.
            Festivals and
            outdoor events abound, offering a kaleidoscope of entertainment options, from open-air concerts
            to art
            exhibitions. </p>
        <p>Evenings are a symphony of city lights and laughter, as residents and visitors alike savor the
            warm nights, creating memories against the backdrop of the urban skyline. Summer in the city is
            a time when
            the metropolis truly comes alive, inviting everyone to partake in its lively spirit.</p>
        <p>Summer, by the ocean or in the city, is a season full of life and energy. And for me, it nenver
            ends.</p>
