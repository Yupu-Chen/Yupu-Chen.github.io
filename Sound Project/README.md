# Aliens Need Dogs
By Yupu Chen, Kyrie Park, Sara Almulla, and Madina Yeleukina

# What is the project? What is the overall concept and theme? What kind of experience were you striving to create?
Our project revolves around a soundscape adventure set in Earth and space, which follows a lone Alien as he looks for companionship on Earth. The overall concept centers around the audios assigned to each frame to portray the story, which allow for the immersion of the viewer into the different environments.

## The moral of the story: stereotypes, exclusion, and the value of friendship
- Humans have stereotypes and think Aliens are dangerous etc– giving people a chance might surprise you
- Pitbulls are not favored by a lot of people (i.e. they are the dangerous outsiders in the pet industry), but the alien has no prejudices and is open-minded
- You can find companionship in the unlikeliest of places, friendship gets us through hard times

# Describe your role and what your contribution was. How did you go about implementing the concept?

##  Sara:

My role was centered largely on illustrating the frames to aid in the visual part of our audiovisual story. I designed half (+ the two simple title and ending frames), while Madina designed the other half. We chose to go for a simple, cartoon-y, and smooth illustration style with no outlines, and our color palette was bright and lively but not too saturated.
![IMG_1203 2](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/144206983/ae78e40e-1a03-4a48-b97c-075369ebf3ae)

We used Procreate to illustrate the frames and their components.

### Screencaps of the scenes I illustrated:
![Untitled_Artwork 17](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/144206983/432e664c-913c-4292-ba21-1a184adec968)

We then reused the city background for later scenes— as you’ll see in Madina’s frames.

### I also designed the alien:

### And the people:
![Untitled_Artwork 18](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/144206983/d5a94fa0-a8c6-4d76-a06b-13038b5d9c23)
Which was a challenge I’ll expand on later.

### After finalizing each design, I worked on writing the script for the narration and then recording it:
- Slide 1: Once upon a dark space, an alien stumbles upon a water planet.
- Slide 2: --
- Slide 3: The people there looked weird. But the alien didn’t care. He was looking for companionship in this galaxy, even if that companion wasn’t blue and bulbous like him.
- Slide 4: Nevermind.
- Slide 5: --
- Slide 6: Wait, what is that thing?
- Slide 7: --
- Slide 8: The pit bull was the perfect friend for our fellow alien. He, like the Martian, was an outsider, a supposedly ‘violent’ stray dog to the humans. They needed each other.
- Slide 9: --
- Slide 10: And so, the pit bull and the alien vowed to stay by each other’s side in allegiance, exploring the galaxy one planet at a time till the end of eternity. Hey! Might as well be eccentric together!

I tried to make it brief but straightforward— with a narrative, quirky, and conversational touch. I wanted to make sure it consulted the story without overpowering the sound effects.


##  Madina:
My role was to draw the second half of the sketches. Even though we agreed on the general style of the frames, I still needed to make sure that my frames are consistent with the frames Sara drew. 

### Dog
I designed the dog’s character from scratch. I tried to make it cartoon-y to match the simplistic style of the alien. But I still needed to add enough details for the pit bull to be recognizable such as shadows and extra facial features. Since the dog is the second main character, I wanted it to have different expressions and postures. I drew 2 postures: standing and sitting, and 2 facial expressions: happy and neutral.

### Ice cream truck
I drew the ice cream truck from scratch. Similar to the dog, I tried to draw it simply, but again with enough details so that people would be interested in looking at the frames. I tried to make it colorful and joyful and hence used very bright colors. 
![alien_meets_dog 6](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/71078095/7ff6b51a-42e5-49e5-bf81-5919cc030229)

Regarding the alien and the background, Sara drew them and shared them with me because we wanted the comics to be consistent. But I needed to alter those illustrations and create more variations of them. In that way, our frames could be more interesting and realistic. 

### Alien
After Sara designed the character, she sent me a png image of the alien. I wanted to add some motion to the character, so I redrew the alien's body, hands, and legs in the same style.

### Background
Sara already drew the city background and we decided to use it for other frames too. But I additionally wanted to show some parallax effect of the alien moving and hence made some changes to the background like positions of the trees and the buildings.

##  Yupu:

I did the sound design of the project. For the sound design, I used Logic Pro X as the workplace. For the audios, I combined our original recordings with some sound samples from the NYU Stock Sound Library and Soundly (all can be accessed through iMacs in the music classroom). Thanks to the multitrack editing function of Logic Pro X, I am able to edit, add effect, and equalize all the tracks easily.

Here's the overal workspace:


<img width="2328" alt="LOGIC WORKSPACE" src="https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/112383893/01c53797-97a7-43cb-8123-734722aeae35">


For example, there are many different layers of the background noice in the city, including the car horn, talking, screaming, and footsteps. I put them on top of each other when necessary to help the narration of the story. Moreover, between different scenes I added fade-in, fade-out, or cross-fade effects (as shown also above) to make natural and smooth transitions and making the addition or removal of some layers not too sharp for the listeners.

Specifically, there are two technique/effects I used to modify the soundtracks. The first only is the effects including equalizer and amplifier, both of which are built in Logic Pro X. Together, by changing the volumes of different frequencies and imitating the functioning of an amplifier, I made the narrations sound like from an ancient, distant story teller and the alien voice more dramatic and spacelike. 


<img width="2418" alt="EFFECTS" src="https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/112383893/138aa3ae-029b-4844-8a0b-63517628c0aa">


Secondly, I used automation function to make the soundtracks balanced in volumes. There are two benefits. The first one is to fix the unequal volume as a result of various sound sources, and the second one is to accentuate the main sounds as the story proceeds. For example, when the alien speaks, I turned down the volume of background noise a bit so that the audience knows the alien voice is what to pay attention to. This adds to the storytelling of the soundscape.

Besides sound design, I helped design and code the webpage. I designed the About button and its content, the spinning earth that leads to the homepage, and the Audio Only button that plays the full audio. These parts of the web design help the audience navigate the website better and give them more flexibility of what to see and what to listen to. Through these designs of mine, I hope the audience could explore and enjoy the story more with their own pace.

##  Kyrie:
For this project, I took care of sound effects, and coding for the website.

For sound effects, I mainly focused on the tracks that could be recorded originally by us. The tracks include the alien's lines, foot steps and people screaming. I enjoy recording myself singing music regularly, so I fortunately had all the equipments I need to record these tasks. For tracks like footsteps, it was used for two scenes; one where people run away from the alien, and one where the alien is walking around after all the people ran away. For the first scene I recorded my own footsteps at the gym in C2 building, where the footsteps sounds clear. For the second scene, I had to record multiple people running around which was not easy to get with out all of their consent, so I recorded three of my friends to make running footsteps multiple times. With the recorded samples, I repeated them and layered over the samples with each other to make a much more caotic sound which fits with the scene. No other echo or distortion in the audio was needed for these tracks. For the alien's voice, I used logic pro X to add different layers of the same audio (my raw voice). With EVOC 20 polysynth, I have changed the pitch, resonance, and tune one by one to get closer to a electronic, low voice - what people generally think of an alien voice.

For coding the website, Yupu and I came up with the idea to use the commic image as the basic background, where the background changes as the user/viewer of the website interacts. At first, using js, we had the next and previous button where each of the button changes the value of the slide number and count variable where according to the slide number, both the background image and audio changes. I also wanted the users of the website to have a thorough listening to the audio for each slide and inserted the function where only the audio ends, they get an option to replay the audio, or move on to the next slide.

<img width="488" alt="code1" src="https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/70956027/ca7344da-e5bf-49f7-95b5-30ad5a9097c8">

This is how I coded the button, and as it shows, everytime the button is clicked, it hides all previous, next, and the replay button, but shows all of them when the audio is 'ended'.

I also didn't want the users to press the previous button on the first slide or the next button on the last slide because then the website will not be able to find the according audio and image for it, and hid the button whenever the user opens the website(first page), and hid the next button on the last page.

# Reflection/Evaluation (initial vs final concept, expectations, goals, problems, results)

##  Sara:

To illustrate the frames, we first had to write the storyline. We were able to finalize this during our first meeting in-class, so I started coming up with the design style and showing my group members straight after. After I finished a scene, I uploaded it to Google Drive for my team members to check in case they had any feedback or felt that modifications needed to be made, which helped clarify the creative vision.

### Drawing the people and their arms was pretty difficult
I'm  not an artist so I'm not very well versed with human anatomy (even if it's cartoon-y), but image references certainly helped. Like in the last project, clipart versions of elements I wanted to illustrate helped me visualize how I wanted the frames to look-- and in turn helped me modify each element to suit our designated styling.
![Untitled_Artwork 19](https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/144206983/47ff3f2f-6fca-42be-9ef6-f54618482cf3)

### Storyboard vs final scene (example)

##  Madina:
During the illustration process, I faced two main challenges. 

The first one involved designing the dog. We agreed beforehand on a specific breed of dog and hence I did not have much freedom regarding how I wanted to design the character. Initially, I drew the dog in a standing position with a neutral facial expression. However, I later struggled with drawing a smiling face and a sitting posture. Through multiple redraws and references to pit bull images, I got the result I was satisfied with.

The second challenge was drawing the frame depicting the dog and the alien levitating to enter the UFO. I wanted to convey the physical forces happening at that moment and hence drew the character a bit stretched. In the case of the alien, it was not difficult because of its simple shape. But when I drew the dog I did not know how to achieve that effect. In my first version, I found a picture of a levitating dog and used it as a reference. But since it did not resemble a pit bull, I went through versions 2 and 3.

##  Yupu:

The hardest part from my side is balancing different soundtracks and manipuling the storytellng by sound. For example, I spent a long time thinking about how long each sound should be for each scene. It's good to make, for instance, the first scene and its sound long so that people can immerse themselves into the story's setting. However, it's a bad idea to make it too long so that people get bored at it in the beginning. The same decision goes for when the narrations come in and what the background sound should be there during the narrations. I overcame this challenge by trying millions of times and comparing it to our original script and designed slides. Moreover, I imagined myself as the potential audience and reflected on what I would expected from the experience. With different trials, the soundscape eventually became what it is now, which in my mind successfully tells the story we want it to tell.


<img width="1322" alt="Screenshot 2023-11-08 at 6 51 28 PM" src="https://github.com/Kyrie21323/Sound-Project/assets/112383893/c64f6492-6671-4db9-a506-f0513d3072b7">


For the website, we didn't plan to add the function of playing the full audio without the slides at first. However, as I finalized the website, I realized that it would be interesting if someone just wants to experience the audio without any visual aid, and it can be a good testament to our soundspace on its ability to tell a story on its own. Therefore, I added this function in the end, and surprisingly it works well both functionally and aesthetically!

##  Kyrie:
While working on this project, the hardest challenge I had was when I was coding. At first, I was thinking of making separate pages for the website and open each according web page when a button is clicked. I later found out that it would be much easier to put all of the functions I need (automatically playing the matching audio, showing the image, hiding and showing buttons when needed) into the button clicked function. After rebuilding my code, everything worked fine except for one little error, which was the the audio, where if the user moved to the next slide and came back, would be played where ever the user last left. The previous audio would also not stop, making multiples sounds at the same time. I wanted the users to listen from the start of the audio, and therefore had to figure out a way to reset the audio setting whenever the user left the page. So, I added

document.getElementById(aud_file[count-1]).pause();

document.getElementById(aud_file[count-1]).currentTime = 0;

these two lines inside the nextbutton, and for previous button it would be [count+1]. The upper one pauses the previous sound when the button is clicked (fixes the multiple audio problem), and the lower line resets the audio time to 0(ables users to listen from the start of the audio when they go back to the previous slide).

It was interesting to use audio functions and consider how we want the users of our website to interact with it.
