### Project Name: Blogging

### Project Description

This website, as its name indicates, is a website for people to create their own blogs. I have this idea because my video is like a personal video blog. It documents my life. So I think it is a good idae to embed this video into a website that does the same thing. My blog, which is also a (fake) submission for nomination for 30MFF at NYU Abu Dhabi, aims at serving as a demo for Blogging as a product for potential users. The ultimate experience I'd like to create with this demo is that the viewers not only can appreictae my blog and video but also can imagine themselves writing their own blogs using Blogging.

### Process

**Structure**: I started with the basic layout of the website. In order to make the contents of different parts of the website clear and highlighted, I divided the website into three subsections instead of scrolldown. These three subsections could be access with their own entry buttons. And since essentially it is a website for people to write something, there should be large space for main texts, so I concentrated the entries to different sections in the sidebar on the left. This can make the user focus on the main contents on the right. 

**Color**: For people to write something down, the website should make them feel calmed, inspired, and focused. To achieve this goal, I mainly employed warm colors, like light blue and light orange. There's one more benefit of using these two colors. They can represent sea and sand, which corresponds to the theme of my video, which is summer. This makes the view feel inside the summer story and ambience that my video aims to represent.

**Interaction**: Firstly, since the website's theme is blogging, there should be no complicated interactions that distract viewers from the main content of the blog. Therefore, I designed little complex interactions within each subsection of the website. However, there are some interactions that make the website more interactive and playful. There are tow interactions that I am particularly proud of. The first one is the zoom-in effect of 30MFF logo (which I made myself) on the home page. The image will zoom in when the mouse hovers onto it. This is interesting because it gives users a feeling of getting into the story instead of merely being directed to another page. The second one is the photo carousel in the blog showing photos of the summer. This complements the video in creating a sense of summer in the blog while adding a bit fun to the user experience.

**Other details**: There are some minor details about the website. For example, in the photo carousel, I replaced the traditional buttons of Previous and Next with two watermelons pointing at two opposite directions. This adds the element from the theme of the video to enhance the feeling of summer. Another example would be the font. I used sans-serif fonts for sidebar entries and serif fonts for main contents. For the entries, I want them to look clean. On the contrary, for the main contents, the point is readability and legibility, and this is why I chose serif fonts.

### Reflections

Again, Blogging is a website that allows people to write their own blogs. My video is embedded in my own blog and is a demo sample of the website. Generally, I think in the specific case of my own blog, the website tells the story of the video. However, it lacks some elements that can show the user how they can create their own blog webpages. For example, there can be an Edit button, an Add button, etc., which are common in any website that allows users to do word editing. This undermines the credibility of this webpage as a demo of Blogging as a potential product. However, since the assignment's requirement is to tell the story of the video, I put major efforts to satisfy this goal. In the future, if Blogging is to be developed into an actual product, I would add these functions above to focus more on the fucntionality of Blogging as a blogging website.
