            <p>
                This is a robotics project that brought emotions to life—literally and mechanically. Inspired by
                Disney’s Inside Out, the project was a unique blend of storytelling and engineering, where a team of us
                built robots to embody the emotions of a student procrastinating on an assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our version of the story took place in the mind of an NYU Abu Dhabi student, struggling to finish an
                assignment. Inside her brain, five emotions—anger, joy, sadness, fear, and disgust—interact, each played
                by robots we designed and built ourselves. To add a twist, we also created two additional robot
                characters: the student’s imaginary friends and a robot designed to represent her looming assignment.
            </p>
            <h5>Development: Joy</h5>
            <p>
                I mainly worked on designing and building the robot character for Joy. In Inside Out, Joy is the
                optimistic and
                energetic leader of the emotions, so my robot had to convey that same sense of enthusiasm and
                positivity. To achieve this, I worked on both the mechanics of its movement and its expressive
                capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Physical construction of Joy includes using a combination of servo motors and lightweight materials to
                ensure that Joy could move in a lively and dynamic way. The appearance of Joy features a tall stature
                and bright colors, designed to mimick the figure in the original Inside Out movie. The robot’s gestures
                were designed to be fluid and open, reflecting the character’s optimistic nature. Besides asthetics,
                several praticial considerations also determined the building of Joy. It has a sound rounded base that
                could support the motors and the weight of the entire boday. The body of Joy was also designed to be a
                cone shape so that it would not shake heavily when moving fast, which is necessary to convey enthusiatic
                emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
                For programming, I used Arduino to control Joy’s movements and interactions. Arduino allowed me
                to integrate various sensors and motors, ensuring that Joy could react to the environment and other
                robots in real-time. The movement of Joy was controlled by two motors. The movement of Joy's arms were
                controlled by two servo motors. For racial expressions, several NeoPixels were used. There were all
                soldered to Arduino and programmed there.
            </p>
            <h5>Performance and Showcasing</h5>
            <p>
                Once all the robots were complete, we brought them together for a live performance. Each robot was
                programmed to represent its corresponding emotion, and together, they mimicked the internal chaos of
                procrastination following prewritten lines. For Joy, the robot played a critical role in lightening the
                mood and trying to motivate
                the student through her struggles.
            </p>
            <p>
                We showcased this project at the Black Box Theater at NYU Abu Dhabi.
            </p>
            <h5>Reflections and Future Steps</h5>
            <p>
                This project was an amazing learning experience for me as well as an introductory lesson to
                Human-Computer Interaction, blending robotics with narrative performance. The performing robot
                represents an interesting field in HCI, which points to how people could convey emtions through robots
                and how people receive emotions from robots. Through performance, robots have received an agency of
                expression that is traditionally believed to be possessed only by human beings. Working on Joy helped
                me sharpen my skills in robotic engineering, particularly in Arduino programming, motion control, and
                physical fabrication techniques like soldering, 3D printing, and laser-cutting.
            </p>
            <p>
                Looking forward, I hope to continue exploring ways in which robotics can merge with art and performance.
                I also plan to further improve Joy’s movement capabilities, potentially adding more advanced AI features
                to make her interactions more spontaneous and lifelike.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                GalleryEverywhere is an experimental project that explores the ideas of ignorant museums, participatory
                curation, and augmented reality. Its goal is to make the curation process accessible to everyone so that
                everyone could make different meanings of museums, galleries, and exhibitions. This project evolved from
                a Unity3D project to a Swift/SwiftUI project with significant improvements in its performance and UI
                design. Future development is expected to break the limitation of physical space to allow users to share
                their own curations with another on the other side of the world.
