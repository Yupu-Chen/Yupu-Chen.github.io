                Enhancing Meditation Through Virtual Reality: The Effect of VR on Mindfulness and Well-Being
            </p>
            <h5>Abstract</h5>
            <p>
                In the evolving nexus of ancient traditions and technological progress, the fusion of millennia-old
                meditation practices with Virtual Reality (VR) unfolds a captivating frontier for well-being. Using VR
                in the realm of meditation is becoming more and more popular with an increasing number of VR meditation
                applications being developed. However, relevant research on the effectiveness and advantages of VR
                meditation over traditional audio-guided meditation alone is scarce and inconclusive. Our research,
                following a preliminary study design, aims at comparing VR meditation to traditional audio practices in
                the dimensions of concentration, temporal perception, and stress reduction. Additionally, we explore the
                possibility and benefits of group meditation sessions in VR against single-user experiences. Our study
                will follow a between-groups design where participants will be immersed in various VR meditative
                settings accompanied by audio instructions. Some participants will experience the session in an alone
                setting, whereas others will take part in a group-setting where they will be joined by other virtual
                characters (avatars). A control group will listen to the same audio medication but without being
                immersed in the VR setting. Participants in all groups will complete both subjective and objective
                reports and tests before and after the experience. These will include self-reported levels of stress and
                concentrations, a Stroop test to assess concentration, and a measurement of the perceived duration of
                the experience. The VR experience itself will be evaluated based on standardized VR questionnaires that
                assess the levels of immersion, presence, and cybersickness. Before starting the meditation,
                participants will have to fill out a pre-experience questionnaire, designed to collect some background
                information and other demographic data and to obtain their self-reported stress levels using a 0 (not at
                all) to 10 (very much) Likert scale; then they will complete a standardized computerized version of the
                Stroop task. The millisecond unit Stroop effect value will be automatically generated by the computer
                and is used to evaluate participants’ concentration levels by comparing their reaction speeds in
                instances where the word and its color match versus where they do not. During the meditation,
                participants will be prompted through audio guidance to rate their own stress and concentration levels
                at various moments, which will help us assess their adaptability to the VR environment and the guided
                audio. We will compare the results of the audio-only meditations and the VR meditation to identify any
                potential differences. Our study has the potential to offer preliminary insights into how VR can be
                applied to meditation and provide valuable guidance for both VR developers and users. It presents an
                alternative perspective for individuals interested in pursuing VR meditation instead of audio-only
                meditation.

            <h5>Implementation</h5>
            <p>
                As the team leader, I designed and implemented the VR scenes for both inddividual and group meditation
                sessions as well as participant survey within the VR scene in Unity3D. Some key aspects the
                implementation include immersiveness and embodiement, which determine the success of the VR environment
                and reliability of the result. To achieve a high level immersiveness and comfortable, authentic
                embodiment, I carefully designed both the surroundings and avatars. In the individual session, the
                spatial relation between the surrounding objects and the embodied avatar is very important. It could not
                be so overwhelming that the participant would feel stressed, nor could it be so distant that the
                participant would feel disconnected from the environment. Threfore, I deliberately removed some of the
                objects, such as grass, trees, and flowers from the surrounding of the avatar to keep the avatar some
                distance from the environment but still possess a sense of presence in the virtual environment. As for
                the group sessions, the presence of other animated avatars is also critical as it has to be natural and
                authentic in order for the participant to feel comfortable to experience meditation sessions with them.
                It is important not to make the presence of other avatars a distracting factor for the participant.
                Thus, I added the self-introduction part of the animated avatars with lip-sync as they speak to enhance
                their credibility to the participant. It is also expected that the participant would feel more
                comfortable to haven the animated avatars in the group meditation session.
            </p>
            <p>
                Both the VR and lip-sync functions are based on the Unity packages introduced by the Instructor and the
                animations of the avatars in group sessions are realized through the built-in animation module of
                Unity3D.
            </p>
            <h5>Result and Discussion</h5>
            <p>
                This study finds varied results regarding various parameters in measuring the effectiveness of VR in
                meditation. Please refer to the Poster image for detailed results and analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
                This study on VR meditation was constrained by the number of participants and the implementation of the
                VR experience. Additionally, the duration of the meditation sessions may have impacted the results. For
                some participants, particularly in the VR environment, the length of meditation might have been too
                long, potentially affecting their concentration and stress levels. Therefore, future research should
                consider a larger sample size, improved VR designs, varied meditation durations consulted with
                professional therapists or psychological experts, and more comprehensive data collection and analysis.

            <h5>Achievement</h5>
            <p>
                The abstract of this study was accepted by the 15th Annual Undergraduate Research Conference on Applied
                Computing at Zayed University in Dubai, UAE, as the poster presentation.
