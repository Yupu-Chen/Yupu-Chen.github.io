            <p>GalleryEverywhere is an iOS AR application that allows users to curate their own exhibitions in the space
                of
                their own choice.
                The idea was inspired by concept of <a
                    href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2017.1373710#abstract"
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">ignorant museums</a>, in which an emancipatory experience of
                knowledge
                creation in the context of art museums is explored, and <a
                    href="https://vanabbemuseum.nl/en/collection-research/research/search-in-research/diy-archive"
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">the Van Abbemuseum's DIY Archive project</a>.
                The goal of GalleryEverywhere is to use AR as a means of creating accessibility and allowing everyone to
                digitally handle and interact
                with works most people would never be able to touch in real life.
            </p>
            <h5>Technology</h5>
            <p>
                Originally, the project was developed in Unity3D with its relatively new integration of ARKit and XRKit
                packages.
                With Unity3D, it was easy to manipulate the AR function with these packages as many functions are
                premade and available to use; however, the precision of some key functions, including plane detection
                and anchor placement, is compromised.
                Therefore, this project was later re-developed in Swift and SwiftUI with a more direct access to ARKit
                (RealityKit in later versions). This new version included new background features like scene
                reconstruction and LiDR if supported the user's device as well as AR Coaching interface provided by
                Apple. The latest version of GalleryEverywhere could detect different planes in real world precisely and
                create anchors accordingly
            </p>
            <h5>User Interface / Interaction</h5>
            <p>
                As an experimental project, the UX/UI is designed to be simple and straightforward to ensure
                accessibility directly to the core function of learning about art works and play with them. Only one
                button is available at the upper right corner of the screen upon openning the APP. Clicking this button
                leads to the built-in art libraries, where the user could get basic information about the work by
                clicking on a specific artwork and decide to put it onto the AR scene by clicking "Add" button.
            </p>
            <p>
                After the user puts at least one artwork to the AR scene, they can now manipulate what they have put
                there. Simply holding and dragging on a particular work will enable the user to move the work on its own
                plane. With two-finger zooming-in-and-out gesture, the user can change the scale of the work in the AR
                scene. By doubleing clicking on onw artwork, the user is able to delete it from the AR scene.
            </p>
            <p>
                The minimalist design is also purposeful to avoid any implicit meaning-making as much as possible on our
                part, externally imposing certain views or understandings of the art
                on users since it is an essential ideology of ignorant museums. Instead, users are able to choose any
                piece from our collection, view some basic factual
                information about it, and if they please, arrange it digitally on the space around them using AR. In
                this independent, individualized curation process, the user might make meanings for their own
                selections, even unconsciously.
            </p>
            <h5>Future Development</h5>
            <p>
                The vision of GalleryEveryhere is not just application where people can work on curations individually,
                but ultimately a platform where people could share and collaborate with others on one curation with
                different spaces. The challenge here is how to best "share" the exhibitions users create. It is
                difficult to
                design a world where we could fully capture tand hen reproduce the spatial data of every user's
                exhibition. A potential path forward may be to ask users to build a 360-degree static image of their
                exhibition, using sliced photographs akin to how some
                applications stitch together panoramas.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technology for building this app was reasonably
                straightforward, and if it were to be built out into a full app, managing the server design, and how
                the community interacts with one another, especially in sharing their experiences, would be the
                utmost priority.
            </p>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                GalleryEverywhere is an experimental project that explores the ideas of ignorant museums, participatory
                curation, and augmented reality. Its goal is to make the curation process accessible to everyone so that
                everyone could make different meanings of museums, galleries, and exhibitions. This project evolved from
                a Unity3D project to a Swift/SwiftUI project with significant improvements in its performance and UI
                design. Future development is expected to break the limitation of physical space to allow users to share
                their own curations with another on the other side of the world.
