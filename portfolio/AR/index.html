            <p>GalleryEverywhere is an iOS AR application that allows users to curate their own exhibitions in the space
                of
                their own choice.
                The idea was inspired by concept of <a
                    href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02601370.2017.1373710#abstract"
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">ignorant museums</a>, in which an emancipatory experience of
                knowledge
                creation in the context of art museums is explored, and <a
                    href="https://vanabbemuseum.nl/en/collection-research/research/search-in-research/diy-archive"
                    style="text-decoration: underline;">the Van Abbemuseum's DIY Archive project</a>.
                The goal of GalleryEverywhere is to use AR as a means of creating accessibility and allowing everyone to
                digitally handle and interact
                with works most people would never be able to touch in real life.
            </p>
            <h5>Technology</h5>
            <p>Originally, the project was developed in Unity3D with its relatively new integration of ARKit and XRKit
                packages.
                With Unity3D, it was easy to manipulate the AR function with these packages as many functions are
                premade and available to use; however, the precision of some key functions, including plane detection
                and anchor placement, is compromised.
                Therefore, this project was later re-developed in Swift and SwiftUI with a more direct access to ARKit
                (RealityKit in later versions). This new version included new background features like scene
                reconstruction and LiDR if supported the user's device as well as AR Coaching interface provided by
                Apple. The latest version of GalleryEverywhere could detect different planes in real world precisely and
                create anchors accordingly
            </p>
            <h5>User Interface / Interaction</h5>
            <p>
                It is simple and straightforward, both to ensure accessibility and to avoid as far as possible, any
                implicit meaning-making on our part, externally imposing certain views or understandings of the art
                on users. Instead, users are able to choose any piece from our selection, view some basic factual
                information about it, and if they please, arrange it digitally on the space around them using AR.
                Once users have arranged all the art they wish, then they are able to create an "exhibition", with
                their own title, description, and images accompanying it. After creating an exhibition, it is shared
                with the rest of the world, and others users can view it, while sharing their own.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key challenges faced (and still yet to be resolved) with this project is how to best
                "share" the exhibitions users create. Our current route is one of practicality--it is difficult to
                image a world where we could fully capture then reproduce the spatial data of every user's
                exhibition. Yet, this implementation is sorely lacking in a true sense of spatiality, which is
                critical to how these exhibitions are arranged. A potential path forward may be to ask users to
                build a 360-degree static image of their exhibition, using spliced photographs akin to how some
                applications stitch together panoramas. The technology for building this app was reasonably
                straightforward, and if it were to be built out into a full app, managing the server design, and how
                the community interacts with one another, especially in sharing their experiences, would be the
                utmost priority.
